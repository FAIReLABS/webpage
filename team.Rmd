### Martin Schobben

<p style="text-align: justify;">
I am an Earth scientist applying creative, data-driven solutions to answer fundamental questions regarding the Earth system in conjunction with the evolution of life. Besides a strong affinity for data-analysis and programming, I like to explore effective ways of communicating results by the optimization of graphical representations of data. Developing solutions to the benefit of data management/governance and open science are currently one of my prime interests.
