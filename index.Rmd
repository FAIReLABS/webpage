It is our mission to stimulate innovation and inclusiveness in natural sciences by helping academics to make their laboratory data: Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR). In addition to supporting research data management, we aim to make the workflow from raw data to processed data more transparent, accessible, and customizable.

*"Good data management is not a goal in itself, but rather is the key conduit leading to knowledge discovery and innovation, and to subsequent data and knowledge integration and reuse by the community after the data publication process." **Mark D. Wilkinson et al. 2016 Nature Scientific Data***
